    <h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a></h1>
        <p>I like the layout of the website, they made it really easy to follow and find what you want even if you just have a general idea. The search bar allows you to look up specific things, or key words in order to find what you are looking for. YouTube is great for many reasons such as the ability to listen to music, watch videos, but also because it allows a platform for influencers that is easy to use and maneuver. The coding is in HTML, and it looks organized, it would make more sense if I knew more about coding. The way the site is laid out makes sense, you open up to the home page which gives you recommendations of what to watch based on your history and the menu is easy to navigate. The site uses three main colors, black, red, and white. The red and black of the logo really stands out on the white page, but the whiteness of the page acts as a good background to the colorful videos that fill the page. One thing that I noticed that was pretty unique is that below the toolbar/menu, there is a second menu with rounded boxes, they help you jump to each category if you so choose, another cool thing is that it allows you to choose who you get your notifications from. You can choose to subscribe to a channel, but you also can choose if they send you notifications on postings or not, most sites say all or nothing. </p>
        
       <h2><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard">Tumblr</a></h2> 
        <p>I don’t really like the layout of the site. THey have way too much wasted space, it looks like just a long line of posts surrounded by the only blue someone could find. The stream is also just a lot of repeated people posting over and over again. They use HTML, but the coding is messy. It needs to be spaced out, especially the first line which is ridiculously long. The layout does make sense in that the menu bar follows you around when you scroll down, but like I said earlier, there is a lot of wasted space, it’s boring. I can navigate around decently well, though this site uses tags to find what you’re looking for which can make things stressful because one picture may have many tags, and some tags don’t make sense. As for colors, they have one solid blue as the background and it’s the same as the logo. The blue does make it easier to look at late at night, but it also makes the site feel dark, which may be good for some of its audience, it’s not the best for attracting new users. One thing that I do like about this site that is pretty unique is that it allows you to post moving memes, for example gifs that don’t require you to go to a different site to look at them. You can add movement which is pretty cool. </p>
        
        <h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></h3> 
        <p>Facebook is a great site, which is why it makes sense that it’s super popular. Facebook is really similar to Tumblr though, what sets it apart is that it utilizes it’s space well. It has the same line of posts down the center of the site, like Tumbler does, but the areas around the page aren’t just blank backgrounds. They have a menu to see if your friends are online, they show a menu bar on the side that gives you short cuts, allows you to jump to different parts of Facebook, and remind you of events you signed up for. The coding is terrifying, I got anxiety just looking at it, there are many repeated functions, and while it’s easy to follow, it’s overwhelming to look at. The layout also makes sense, it allows you to navigate easy through the site. The scrolling is just limited to the center. It’s pretty similar to youtube in the sense that it uses a neutral background to counteract the colorful posts, but it also has the menus be white and the rest of the background a soft grey which allows a cleaner look. Some little things that makes it cool is not only the use of color, but the fact you can choose who you prioritize on your feed. It also has a circular logo rather than a box. </p>
