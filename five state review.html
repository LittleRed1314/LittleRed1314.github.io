    <titile> My five state reviews</titile>
</head>
<body>
    <h><a href="https://alaska.gov">Alaska</a></h>
    <p>I like the colors they used, the blue they chose as the border worked really well with the nature pictures they used of things like a sunset or mountains. There was also like an ombre thing going on in the header which I liked. </p>
    <p>The cite loads really quicly, there is barely any loading time. The menu is easy to navigate, things are very organized on the cite, which I like. It almost reminds me of a sectioned tupperware, everything has it's place. This makes it really easy to find what I'm looking for, say if I wanted to know about getting a fishing or hunting license after monig there, it would be easy to find inthe resident's living section.  </p>
    <p>I did two screen tests on size adaptation. I used my phone and I minimized the screen. It adapted really well on my phone. The screen on my phone covered the whole website. When I minimied it though, it didn't adapt, you would have to scroll to get to where you want to be. </p>
    <p>Over all, I really liked this website, if I needed to do look at something on the site, but didn;t have access to a computer, its design is really conveniant because it will adapt to my phone, but also because it's easy to navigate.</p>
     <h1><a href="https://www.iowa.gov/">Iowa</a></h1>
    <p>I really like the astetic of this page, they have really cool animations added. When you first load the screen, it outlines 
    "THIS IS IOWA" and the search bar in the website where you can ask questions has graphics in typing giving suggested/common questions. I really like the way there is a picture in the background under a really pretty blue. It kinda reminds me of the designs in NCIS. </p>
    <p>The website does take a little bit to load all the photos and graphics when you open it up or when you follow links to the different categories, but the wait isn't horrible. The menu is easy to follow and if you don't know what category something would be under, you can search up what you're looking for and it will help you find what you need. </p>
    <p>The screen works well on laptops, however, unlike Alaska's, the design on the mobile website is different, it doesn't have the photo background, and it feels a little squished and messy. The minimizex version also doesn't adapt and you have to scroll over to find what you need.</p>
<h3><a href="https://oklahoma.gov/"> Oklahoma</a></h3>
    <p>The design of this website is very different than the last two, there's no menu bar. There's also a lot more pictures than in the last two. While this one does look nice, it feels more like a news website rather than a state website. The pictures are really well done though. Plus, there isn't much of a loading time, it's not as fast as Alaska, but not as long as Iowa.</p>
    <p>The website isn't horrible to navigate, definatly more work though. It feels like the designer of this website wanted to be done quicker. There is a "Popular Resources" section, which sort of acts like a menu. It has a few of the same catagories that the others had, however, there are significantly less options. On this page, you have to look up what you want in the search bar at the top right. This means you have to have some idea of what you're looking for. Which could be confusing. </p>
    <p>One thing that this website does better than the previous two at is adpating to size changes. When minimized, the screen adapts to fit the new window, you don't have to scroll over. Their mobile website also adapts well to the smaller size. It did change a few things but, the page stays organized, noting feels crammed. I really like that because it allows you to look at multiple things on a computer at once, so if you needed to open something else up in order to fill out an aplication or something along those lines, you wouldn't have to keep clicking back and forth.</p>
 <h4><a href="https://www.tn.gov/"> Tennessee</a></h4>
    <p>Tennessee and Iowa have an almost identical basic design, however, this one includes a menue and a search bar which makes it easier to navigate. The pictures on this page are less nature and look to be more formal and traditional. I've notces that all of the pages so far, except Iowa, have had a similar color scheme, they all include blue with yellows and sometimes red. This page seems more formal than Tennessee.</p>
    <p>While the menu makes it easier to find things, the wait time for the page you need to load is the slowest so far. The pictures take awile to load in. The adaptation to different sizes though is exactly like Tennessee, they both adapt very well to the size windows avaibale in minimized and mobile screens.</p>
<h5><a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/">Vermont</a></h5>
    <p>This site reminds me of a photo collage, because that's the style for the home page. Photos are really pretty, I really like the tree covered hill photo on the top. I really like that they take up the whole screen. They went into a lot of details in the designing of this site, I accedently clicked something when the screen was loading and it sent me to a different page, and the amount of work that went into this states website is amazing. The menus in all the sections I looked at were really easy to follow, and again they allow them to look up what their looking for if the viewer isn't sure. All the pages are really well organized, it feels like all the space they had to work with was well used.</p>
    <p>I don't like that it opens up new tabs everytime you click an item on the menu,it makes your tabs bar fill up really quickly and makes finding specific articles difficult, but I can see how it could also be useful. If you need to jump between pages, it's easier to when they're on different tabs.  The loading on the tabs amd site is decenlty quick, it has like a two or three second loading time with some sites, but for the most part it's almost instant. </p>
    <p>The adaptability of the page was also really nice, when minimized the page adapted well to the space and you dont have to scroll across the page to fing something. The mobile phone looks different only in the way the photos are lined up, rather than keeping theri normal side by side design, they were stacked on top of eachother to make sure the photos whouldn't be too small to see on your mobile devices.</p>
<h6>Rankings</h6>
<ol>
    <li>My personal favorate would be Vermonts. Over all, it had one of my favorite designs, I really liked the amount of detail was there to make sure you could find what you need. I also really liked that it could adapt to the differnt screen sizes well because, for me that's important because I don't carry my laptop with me regularly, so my phone is how I do a lot of things like read the news and do schoolwork on my breaks. It waas really easy to follow and the pages loading time was fast enough not to annoy me, but slow enough for me to not make too many accidental mistakes. The only complaint I would have is the new tab for everything. It made it difficult to remember where the original tab was.</li>
    
    <li>My second would be Alaska because I thought the way they organized everything made the site easy to use and the loading time was by far the best of all of them. The photos that they used were beautiful as well. The one downfall it has is that it doesn't adapt well when minimized.  </li>
    
    <li>My third favorite state site would be Iowa. I really loved the designs on the page and the organization of the page. THe site was easy to navigate through and it was a close call with Alaska, however, the loading time on this site was s bit slower than Alaska, so it took the 3. </li>
    
    <li>My fourth favorite state site would be Tennessee, while it was a close call with Oklahoma, Tennesse won out just because it was more formal and because it had an easy to follow menu on the top rather that just a search bar. The adaptation was the same. The reasonwhy it's a close call is because the load time for this site was the slowest out of all of them, however, the time wasn't too painful. </li>
    
    <li>My least favorite favorite was Oklahoma. While the site homepage was alright and it did adapt well to multiple screen sizes, navigating through the site was a pain.</li>
