    <h><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">Dream Host</a> </h>
    <p>Dream Host offers 7 main options to choose from- WordPress, hosting, websites, domains, email, proservices, and academy. Their website was really easy to go through to find information, and they offer tips before you choose what subplans you want so you can get a better understanding of what you're looking for. I like also that they had options for monthly payments, yearly and three year apart payments.</p>
    <p>In the WordPress option there are three subcategories-WordPress Basic, DreamPress, and VPS for WordPress.</p>
    <ul>

    <p>Host Gater also lets people buy and transfer domains. They have 15 to choose from all with verying prices.</p>
        </ul>
<h>My Opinion</h>
    <p> If you're really new to this sort of thing I would use Dream hosts or host gator because they were really easy sites to find things, they had whole sections dedicated to teaching, and because they are really helpful (they both had little helper chats pop up to check in on me). Any of the three would work though because they offer basic package deals, but I would do research into what you need first.</p>
