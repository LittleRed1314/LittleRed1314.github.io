            <h3><b>Problems with Camping:</b></h3>
            <p><img src="seasons-images/mom-waterfall.jpg" class="summertime"></p>
            <li>You get really gross after not showering</li>
            <li>The ground can be extremely uncomfortable</li>
            <li>nights get decently cold</li>
            <li>Cleaning supplies is really difficult when you don't have running water</li>
            <li>Mosquitos</li>
             <h3><b>Solutions:</b></h3>
            <li>They make shower bags for camping that work really well. You could warm up water over the fire so it's not cold</li>
            <li>Braid your hair and bring dry shampoo</li>
            <li>Bring a rake and broom with you. You can rake up and of the sticks, pine needles and anything else painful out of the area. Use the broom to clean out the tent when you set it up to get rid of anything in the tent.</li>
            <li>Put a layer of blankets underneath you and above you while in your sleeping bag to keep heat trapped in on both sides.</li>
            <li>If you bring a storage bin you can use it to clean dishes, then you can dry it out with towels and use it for storage.</li>
            <li>The shower tool also works alright to rinse them off.</li>
            <li>burning orange peels works decently well, but for the best results, bring more bug spray than you think you'll need and get one of the mosquito repelling candles.</li>
